    "Immediately chooses an action\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial state = In(Arad)\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 3. Actions\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Assigns a numeric cost to each path\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells the agent which solution is better.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Romania problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost = total distance (km)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",

    "State space graph: states are unique\n",
    "\n",
    "Search tree: the same state can appear many times\n",

    "Will it find a solution if one exists?\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "BFS: Yes (finite branching)\n",
    "\n",
    "DFS: Not always (can get stuck in loops)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Optimality\n",
    "\n",
    "Will it find the best solution?\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "BFS: Optimal if all step costs are equal\n",
    "\n",
    "UCS / A*: Yes (under conditions)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Time complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "How many nodes does it generate?\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "branching factor b\n",

    "depth d\n",

    "\n",
    "How much memory does it use?\n",
    "\n",
    "Key idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "BFS uses a lot of memory\n",
    "\n",
    "DFS uses much less memory\n",
    "\n",
    "A* can be very memory-heavy\n",
    "\n",
    "### One-paragraph exam-ready summary\n",
    "\n",
    "A state space graph is a mathematical representation of a problem in which nodes correspond to unique world states and edges correspond to actions. A search tree, constructed during search, represents paths through the state space and may contain repeated states due to different paths and cycles. Because search trees can grow infinitely even when the state space graph is finite, search algorithms must be evaluated using completeness, optimality, time complexity, and space complexity.\n"
